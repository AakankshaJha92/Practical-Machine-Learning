Practical Machine Learning Course Project
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. A training set of data of 6 people were given and the goal of this project is to predict (20 cases of testing set) the class of the exercise using the data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. <br>

Data Source for this project <http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har> <br>

Six participants performed bicep excercises in five different ways: <br>
1. Class A - Exactly according to the correct specification <br>
2. Class B - Throwing the elbows to the front <br>
3. Class C - Lifting the dumbbell only halfway  <br>
4. Class D - Lowering the dumbbell only halfway <br>
5. Class E - Throwing the hips to the front <br>
